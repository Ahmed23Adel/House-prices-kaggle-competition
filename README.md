1- Used PCA to lower number of feature from 250 to only 20
2- used grid search and linear regression to model 
3- provided some good question and answered them using data analysis and provided in conclusion a summary of that

Conclusoin:



1.   Here we see the FV(Floating Village Residential) has highest average priced, followed by RL (Residential Low DensityResidential Low Density: "Low density residential zones" are locations intended for housing that include a lot of open space. )

2.   Average Lot Area in all conditions is 10516.828082191782 squared feet which is equal to 977.0448793198631 meters squared

3. Low residential denisty has higest average LotArea, and Floating villages has small average,

4. Here we see the FV have number of paved allyes, lowest is due to RH (Residential High Density)

5. Most regular lots are in RL (Residential Low Density)

6. linera relationshop exist between overqual and saleprice, but still some having high overall quality, have low price, we treated them as outliers.

7. newer houses have higher prices by large difference, nearly equal to  250kâˆ’125k=75k

8. Actully they have quite close numver of highqual in both new and old, i think it thy are corelated

9. Most year having lots of houses buits is in 2006, and in that year, a 67 houses was built 

10. in second floow the difference is big, in new houses have double the size of second floow size in old houses

11. for new houses, avg second floor in squared feet is 416.63201094391246, and in old houses is 277.161865569273

Limitation ðŸ¤š
The dataset is so small, about only 1500 samples, they are not large enough to build a hypothese based on it, however, most of outcomes are like what i expected, no wierd relation existed
